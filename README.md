Rust code that generates a random maze using a depth-first search algorithm. The algorithm creates a 2D array of cells, marks some cells as visited, and then randomly traverses the unvisited neighbors of each cell until it has visited every cell in the maze.

This code is intentionally hard, as it involves advanced concepts like recursion, ownership, and borrowing. It also requires some knowledge of Rust syntax and data structures.
